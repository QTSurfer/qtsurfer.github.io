# Changelog

All notable changes to the QTSurfer OpenAPI contract are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). While the API is
pre-1.0, its version follows the version in `openapi.yaml`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.115.1] — 2026-09-07

### Changed 🔄

- `ScalarStrategyParamValue` names the scalar values accepted by `executeBacktest.params` and
  returned in `ResultMap.params`. The JSON contract is unchanged; generated clients now expose a
  stable component-derived type instead of a path-derived anonymous model.

## [0.115.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added ✨

- Dataset resources and completed upload versions can expose `dataUrl`, a presigned URL for the
  stored data, and `dataFormat`, which identifies that data as `lastra` or `parquet`.
- Dataset upload accepts a CSV or parquet file directly, or a gzip/zip containing exactly one of
  those files.

### Changed 🔄

- `DatasetVersion.bytes` now describes the stored data rather than the originally uploaded bytes.
  Read `dataFormat` before choosing a reader.
- `JobState.size` is an upfront estimate for single executions and plain sweeps; a value of `0`
  identifies contexts predating the estimate, or walk-forward sweeps where it is not calculated.
- `deflatedSharpe` is absent when it cannot be meaningfully computed, rather than a zero value.
